I am a Master's student in the three-year program at Guangdong University of Technology (GDUT), under the supervision of Professor Bingxiang Yuan. Throughout my academic journey, I have worked closely with him. My research focuses on the intersection of geotechnical engineering and artificial intelligence (AI). I am looking for a PhD position. If you are interested in my research or have any industry collaboration opportunities, please feel free to contact me. [Ieonard805@outlook.com](Ieonard805@outlook.com)
